<h3>
About
</h3>

<p>
JCAT is the software platform for the Market Design Competition (CAT) under the umbrella of the Trading Agent Competition (TAC). The CAT Competition supports multiple markets that run in parallel and compete against each other to attract traders and make profit. Each entrant of the CAT Competition runs a market, and set the market rules so as to win the game according to a certain set of assessment criteria. Traders, which are provided by the competition organizers, can move between markets to explore and select the best market to trade in to maximize their own profits. JCAT includes the CAT game server, trading strategies and market selection strategies to configure trading agents, i.e., traders, and a parameterized, reference implementation of market mechanism that enables entrants to get started easily.
</p>

<p>
JCAT has also been used extensively in experimental mechanism design research and education. If you would like to collaborate on JCAT-based research, or support further development of JCAT, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:jniu at gc.cuny.edu">Jinzhong Niu</a>.

<p>
Thank you for using JCAT!
